                    <p>Because the panda is a part of the bear species, it's classified as a carnivore. However, a panda's diet is mostly herbivorous as it is excusively bamboo. Pandas eat as much as 20 to 31 pounds of bamboo shoots a day. Due to this diet, pandas have adapted a large size and round faces.</p>

                    <p>Pandas are a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and fragmentation from deforestation. They used to be endangered due to poaching but gun laws and the removal of human residence from reserves have increased their population. Zoos and other conservation places have worked significantly allowing pandas to be reclassified as vulnerable. </p>
