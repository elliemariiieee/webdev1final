                    <p>Zebras are the cousins of horses and are native to Africa. They have black and white stripes that come in different patterns that're unique to the individual zebra.</p>

                    <p>Zebras are grazers and eat mostly grass. Sometimes they'll eat bark, leaves and fruits. Depending on the amount of food available to them, they can spend 60-80% of their lives eating. They are more water dependent than other species so it's easy to find them near water sources.</p>

                    <p>Grevy's zebras are endangered, mountain zebras are vulnerable and plains zebras are near threatened. All zebras are threatened by hunting and habitat destruction. Luckily, there are a range of protection areas in countries such as Kenya, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Namibia, and South Africa.</p>
